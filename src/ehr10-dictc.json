   "Bionic Reading involves bolding the initial letters of words, with the idea that this might help guide the reader's eyes more effectively": "Bionic Reading, whereby words' initial letters are presented in bold",
   "it could also make reading harder": "On the other hand one might also predict a detriment",
   "unnecessary focus on certain letters": "unnecessary fixations on words that would otherwise be skipped",
   "disrupting the visual flow of a word": "visual inconsistencies within words caused by bold versus non-bold letters with a disregard for syllable- or morpheme boundaries",
   "The study found no evidence that Bionic Reading is beneficial":"The present results do not provide evidence that Bionic Reading is helpful",
   "regardless of how fast or slow the participants read":"held true both in early and late trials, and both in slower and faster readers",
   "it just didn't show any significant benefits in this particular study":"I may add that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; and I should emphasize that Bayesian statistical analyses provided strong evidence neither for the alternative-, nor for the null-hypothesis (Footnote 2)",
   "with 1600 measurements per condition, the study was statistically robust": "with 1600 measurements per condition, the study met the recommendations of Brysbaert and Stevens (2018) for an a priori estimated statistical power of âˆ¼0.80",
   "a larger sample size might be needed to detect any minor benefits":"some small but significant benefit of Bionic Reading might be observed when testing a sample that is several orders of magnitude greater than the present sample of 32 participants",
   "any observed benefits would be so small that they might not be meaningful for everyday readers": "if that would be what is needed to argue for the method's efficacy, then the method would definitely not be guaranteed to benefit the individual reader",
   "only included university students without reading difficulties like dyslexia": "university students here, none of whom reported to be dyslexic",
   "doesn't depend on a person's reading proficiency": "absence of an interaction with individual reading speed",
   "this conclusion is preliminary": "seen as a mere preliminary sign that Bionic Reading's efficacy is not a function of the user's proficiency",
   "Bionic Reading could help people with serious reading problems, such as dyslexia":"I leave open the possibility that the method may help people with serious reading difficulties, as is the case in dyslexia",
   "the theoretical principles behind Bionic Reading apply to all readers, not just those with dyslexia":"the theoretical underpinnings of the method as described in Section 1.1 apply to non-dyslexic readers all the same; and indeed, the company's central claims are addressed to the general population, rather than dyslexic readers in specific",
   "the claims made by the company promoting Bionic Reading should be viewed with caution unless future studies indicate clear benefits" : "Thus, even if future investigations reveal a benefit for dyslexic readers, the present results would nonetheless warrant attenuation of the claims that are currently being made"
