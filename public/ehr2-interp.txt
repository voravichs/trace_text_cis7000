A 67-year-old man, who recently had a heart attack and was newly diagnosed with heart failure, visited the hospital because of chest pain. His blood pressure was very high when he arrived. Tests showed that his heart was pumping blood with only 25-30% efficiency. He was given medications to help with his heart function and to manage his high blood pressure. Despite these treatments, he has been struggling more with breathing after walking just a short distance, a change from being able to walk much more without trouble a few months ago. He also experiences discomfort when lying down unless he uses two pillows and wakes up at night because of excess mucus. He doesn't have swelling in his legs. After stopping alcohol and reducing cigarette use, his blood pressure has improved. The doctors are checking his kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. They are also recommending changes to his current medications. They have advised him to consult a nutritionist regarding diet changes and encouraged him to quit smoking and continue avoiding alcohol.
